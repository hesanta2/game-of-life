# Game of Life in Angular

This project implements Conway's Game of Life using Angular. The Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. The game consists of a two-dimensional grid of cells, where each cell can be either alive or dead. The state of each cell in the grid is determined by its eight neighboring cells, according to a set of simple rules.
